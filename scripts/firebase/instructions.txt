To generate the serviceAccountKey.json file:

Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com) and select your project.
Click on the "Project settings" gear icon.
Navigate to the "Service Accounts" tab.
Under the "Firebase Admin SDK" section, click on the "Generate new private key" button.
This will download the serviceAccountKey.json file, which you can save and use for server-side authentication with the Firebase Admin SDK.
Make sure to keep your serviceAccountKey.json file secure and do not share it publicly, as it provides privileged access to your Firebase project.

create code akin to import_anusham.js
cd to project root and do this at command line: npm install firebase-admin
cd to where import_anusham.js is and do this at command line: node import_anusham.js

To start server for correct env
    - open environment.ts 
    - change this line to have the correct env var
    (change dev to test, staging etc - see that those have entries in angular.json under build and serve sections)
    -const environment = envConfig['dev'];

    -and then do ng serve --configuration=dev (or whatever other env you want)

    Note:
    We have one environment.ts file and one environment.config.json file with dev, test, staging and prod entries
